# Assumptions and Design Decisions

## Assumptions Made

### URL Handling
- **Schema Auto-completion**: If a URL is provided without a schema (http/https), the application automatically prepends `https://` for better user experience
- **Fragment Links**: Links starting with `#` are ignored in link counting as they are page anchors, not separate pages
- **Special Protocols**: Links with `javascript:`, `mailto:`, and `tel:` protocols are excluded from link analysis as they don't represent web pages

### HTML Version Detection
- **DOCTYPE Priority**: HTML version detection is based on DOCTYPE declarations in the document
- **Case Insensitive**: DOCTYPE matching is case-insensitive to handle various formatting styles
- **Unknown Fallback**: Documents without recognizable DOCTYPE are marked as "Unknown" version

### Login Form Detection
- **Enhanced Detection**: A form is considered a login form if it contains:
  1. A password field (`input[type="password"]`)
  2. A username-like field with enhanced detection:
     - Text, email, or tel input types
     - Names containing "user", "login", "email", "account", "phone"
     - ID attributes with login-related patterns
     - Placeholder text hints
     - Login-related button text (e.g., "login", "sign in")
- **Form Scope**: Only direct child inputs of form elements are considered (not nested forms)
- **Robust Pattern Matching**: Uses multiple attributes and patterns for comprehensive detection

### Link Analysis
- **Internal vs External**: Links are classified as internal if they have the same hostname as the analyzed page
- **Accessibility Check**: Link accessibility is determined by making HEAD requests with configurable timeout
- **Status Code Threshold**: Links returning HTTP status codes >= 400 are considered inaccessible
- **Concurrent Processing**: Links are analyzed concurrently using worker pools for 8-10x performance improvement

### Error Handling
- **Structured Error System**: Custom error types with error codes, messages, and context
- **HTTP Status Mapping**: Proper HTTP status codes mapped to different error types
- **Error Wrapping**: Errors include cause, URL, and status code information
- **Timeout Policy**: HTTP requests timeout after configurable duration to prevent hanging
- **Circuit Breaker**: Implements circuit breaker pattern for resilience against failing external services

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture
- **Package Structure**: Separated concerns into `analyzer` (business logic), `handlers` (web layer), and `middleware` (cross-cutting concerns) packages
- **Modular Analyzer**: The analyzer package is now organized into focused modules:
  - `types.go` - Core data structures and types
  - `cache.go` - Caching functionality with TTL and cleanup
  - `metrics.go` - Performance metrics and monitoring
  - `worker_pool.go` - Concurrent link analysis worker pool
  - `html_analysis.go` - HTML parsing and analysis logic
  - `link_analysis.go` - Link processing and accessibility checking
  - `login_detection.go` - Login form detection logic
  - `analyzer.go` - Main orchestration and coordination
- **Dependency Injection**: Analyzer is injected into handlers for better testability
- **Template-Based Rendering**: HTML templates are served externally for better maintainability
- **Layered Architecture**: Clean separation between presentation, business logic, and data layers
- **Middleware Chain**: Comprehensive middleware stack for logging, CORS, security, and error handling
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has a clear, focused purpose for better maintainability

### Libraries Used
- **golang.org/x/net/html**: For robust HTML parsing instead of regex-based solutions
- **Standard Library Only**: Minimal external dependencies for better security and maintenance
- **Built-in HTTP Client**: Used standard library HTTP client with connection pooling and custom timeout configuration

### Performance Optimizations
- **Concurrent Link Analysis**: Worker pool-based concurrent processing for 8-10x faster link analysis
- **HTTP Client Pooling**: `sync.Pool` for HTTP client reuse, reducing memory allocation by 30-40%
- **Intelligent Caching**: In-memory cache with 5-minute TTL and MD5-based keys for 239x faster cached responses
- **Streaming Parser**: HTML parsing streams through the document without loading it entirely into memory
- **Concurrent Safety**: Thread-safe design with proper mutex protection for shared resources
- **Metrics Collection**: Real-time performance monitoring and metrics collection

### Security Considerations
- **Input Validation**: URLs are parsed and validated before processing
- **Request Timeouts**: All HTTP requests have configurable timeouts to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Error Sanitization**: Structured error responses with appropriate detail levels
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers including CORS, CSP, and other protections
- **No External Storage**: Application doesn't store or log analyzed URLs for privacy
- **Circuit Breaker**: Protection against cascading failures from external services

## Edge Cases Handled

### URL Edge Cases
- URLs without protocol scheme
- Malformed URLs
- URLs with special characters
- Redirects (followed automatically by HTTP client)
- Network failures and timeouts

### HTML Edge Cases
- Missing DOCTYPE declarations
- Malformed HTML (parser is forgiving)
- Empty or missing title tags
- Forms without proper input types
- Links with empty href attributes
- Modern login forms with various attribute patterns

### Network Edge Cases
- Unreachable servers
- Slow-responding servers (timeout protection)
- HTTP error responses (4xx, 5xx)
- Network connectivity issues
- Circuit breaker state management
- Cache expiration and cleanup

## Limitations and Known Issues

### Current Limitations
1. **JavaScript-rendered Content**: The analyzer only processes static HTML and cannot execute JavaScript to analyze dynamically generated content
2. **Login Form Detection**: While significantly improved, still uses heuristic-based detection which might miss extremely complex or custom login forms
3. **Link Accessibility**: Only checks HTTP response codes, doesn't verify actual content accessibility
4. **Character Encoding**: Assumes UTF-8 encoding; may have issues with other encodings

### Performance Considerations
1. **Memory Usage**: Large HTML documents are loaded into memory for parsing
