# Assumptions and Design Decisions

## Assumptions Made

### URL Handling
- **Schema Auto-completion**: If a URL is provided without a schema (http/https), the application automatically prepends `https://` for better user experience
- **Fragment Links**: Links starting with `#` are ignored in link counting as they are page anchors, not separate pages
- **Special Protocols**: Links with `javascript:`, `mailto:`, and `tel:` protocols are excluded from link analysis as they don't represent web pages

### HTML Version Detection
- **DOCTYPE Priority**: HTML version detection is based on DOCTYPE declarations in the document
- **Case Insensitive**: DOCTYPE matching is case-insensitive to handle various formatting styles
- **Unknown Fallback**: Documents without recognizable DOCTYPE are marked as "Unknown" version

### Login Form Detection
- **Required Fields**: A form is considered a login form if it contains both:
  1. A password field (`input[type="password"]`)
  2. A username-like field (text, email, or default input types with names containing "user", "login", or "email")
- **Form Scope**: Only direct child inputs of form elements are considered (not nested forms)

### Link Analysis
- **Internal vs External**: Links are classified as internal if they have the same hostname as the analyzed page
- **Accessibility Check**: Link accessibility is determined by making HEAD requests with 30-second timeout
- **Status Code Threshold**: Links returning HTTP status codes >= 400 are considered inaccessible

### Error Handling
- **Timeout Policy**: HTTP requests timeout after 30 seconds to prevent hanging
- **Status Code Exposure**: HTTP status codes are included in error responses for debugging
- **Generic Error Messages**: Internal errors are not exposed in detail to prevent information leakage

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture
- **Package Structure**: Separated concerns into `analyzer` (business logic) and `handlers` (web layer) packages
- **Dependency Injection**: Analyzer is injected into handlers for better testability
- **Template Embedding**: HTML template is embedded in the binary for single-file deployment

### Libraries Used
- **golang.org/x/net/html**: For robust HTML parsing instead of regex-based solutions
- **Standard Library Only**: Minimal external dependencies for better security and maintenance
- **Built-in HTTP Client**: Used standard library HTTP client with custom timeout configuration

### Performance Optimizations
- **HEAD Requests**: Used HEAD requests for link accessibility checking to minimize bandwidth
- **Streaming Parser**: HTML parsing streams through the document without loading it entirely into memory
- **Concurrent Safety**: Thread-safe design allows multiple simultaneous analyses

### Security Considerations
- **Input Validation**: URLs are parsed and validated before processing
- **Request Timeouts**: All HTTP requests have timeouts to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Error Sanitization**: Internal error details are not exposed to end users
- **No External Storage**: Application doesn't store or log analyzed URLs for privacy

## Edge Cases Handled

### URL Edge Cases
- URLs without protocol scheme
- Malformed URLs
- URLs with special characters
- Redirects (followed automatically by HTTP client)

### HTML Edge Cases
- Missing DOCTYPE declarations
- Malformed HTML (parser is forgiving)
- Empty or missing title tags
- Forms without proper input types
- Links with empty href attributes

### Network Edge Cases
- Unreachable servers
- Slow-responding servers (timeout protection)
- HTTP error responses (4xx, 5xx)
- Network connectivity issues

## Limitations and Known Issues

### Current Limitations
1. **JavaScript-rendered Content**: The analyzer only processes static HTML and cannot execute JavaScript to analyze dynamically generated content
2. **Login Form Detection**: Uses heuristic-based detection which might miss complex login forms or flag false positives
3. **Link Accessibility**: Only checks HTTP response codes, doesn't verify actual content accessibility
4. **Character Encoding**: Assumes UTF-8 encoding; may have issues with other encodings

### Performance Limitations
1. **Sequential Link Checking**: Links are checked sequentially, which can be slow for pages with many links
2. **Memory Usage**: Large HTML documents are loaded into memory for parsing
3. **No Caching**: Results are not cached, requiring full analysis for each request

## Possible Improvements

### Feature Enhancements
1. **JavaScript Support**: Integrate headless browser (e.g., Puppeteer/Playwright) for dynamic content analysis
2. **Advanced Login Detection**: Machine learning-based form classification for better accuracy
3. **SEO Analysis**: Add meta tag analysis, image alt text checking, and other SEO metrics
4. **Accessibility Audit**: Include WCAG compliance checking and accessibility scoring
5. **Performance Metrics**: Measure page load time, size analysis, and resource optimization suggestions

### Technical Improvements
1. **Concurrent Link Checking**: Implement goroutine pool for parallel link accessibility testing
2. **Result Caching**: Add Redis or in-memory caching to avoid re-analyzing recent URLs
3. **Database Storage**: Store analysis history and provide analytics dashboard
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
5. **API Authentication**: Add API key authentication for production use

### User Experience
1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket-based live updates during analysis
2. **Export Functionality**: Allow exporting results to PDF, CSV, or JSON formats
3. **Batch Analysis**: Support analyzing multiple URLs simultaneously
4. **Historical Data**: Show analysis history and trend comparisons
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Improve mobile responsiveness and touch interactions

### Deployment and Operations
1. **Docker Support**: Add Dockerfile and docker-compose configuration
2. **Health Checks**: Implement health check endpoints for monitoring
3. **Metrics Collection**: Add Prometheus metrics for operational visibility
4. **Configuration Management**: External configuration file support
5. **Logging**: Structured logging with different levels and formats

### Code Quality
1. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing with real web pages
2. **Load Testing**: Performance testing under concurrent load
3. **Code Coverage**: Achieve higher test coverage (currently focused on core functionality)
4. **Documentation**: Add GoDoc comments for all public APIs
5. **Linting**: Integrate golangci-lint for code quality enforcement
